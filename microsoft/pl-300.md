Suggested Answer: Box 1: Dual -Customer should use the dual storage mode.Dual: Tables with this setting can act as either cached or not cached, depending on the context of the query that's submitted to the Power BI dataset. In some cases, you fulfill queries from cached data. In other cases, you fulfill queries by executing an on-demand query to the data source.Note: You set the Storage mode property to one of these three values: Import, DirectQuery, and Dual.Box 2: Dual -You can set the dimension tables (Customer, Geography, and Date) to Dual to reduce the number of limited relationships in the dataset, and improve performance.Box 3: DirectQuery -Sales should use the DirectQuery storage mode.DirectQuery: Tables with this setting aren't cached. Queries that you submit to the Power BI datasetג€"for example, DAX queriesג€"and that return data fromDirectQuery tables can be fulfilled only by executing on-demand queries to the data source. Queries that you submit to the data source use the query language for that data source, for example, SQL.Box 4: Import -Import: Imported tables with this setting are cached. Queries submitted to the Power BI dataset that return data from Import tables can be fulfilled only from cached data.Reference:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-storage-mode

Question #: 5
Topic #: 1

[All PL-300 Questions]

HOTSPOT -You have two Azure SQL databases that contain the same tables and columns.For each database, you create a query that retrieves data from a table named Customer.You need to combine the Customer tables into a single table. The solution must minimize the size of the data model and support scheduled refresh in powerbi.com.What should you do? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.Hot Area: 
Suggested Answer: Box 1: Append Queries as New -When you have additional rows of data that you'd like to add to an existing query, you append the query.There are two append options:* Append queries as new displays the Append dialog box to create a new query by appending multiple tables.* Append queries displays the Append dialog box to add additional tables to the current query.Incorrect: When you have one or more columns that you'd like to add to another query, you merge the queries.Box 2: Disable loading the query to the data modelBy default, all queries from Query Editor will be loaded into the memory of Power BI Model. You can disable the load for some queries, especially queries that used as intermediate transformation to produce the final query for the model.Disabling Load doesn't mean the query won't be refreshed, it only means the query won't be loaded into the memory. When you click on Refresh model in PowerBI, or when a scheduled refresh happens even queries marked as Disable Load will be refreshed, but their data will be used as intermediate source for other queries instead of loading directly into the model. This is a very basic performance tuning tip, but very important when your Power BI model grows bigger and bigger.Reference:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/append-querieshttps://radacad.com/performance-tip-for-power-bi-enable-load-sucks-memory-up

To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.Hot Area: 
Suggested Answer: Box 1: Merge -There are two primary ways of combining queries: merging and appending.* When you have one or more columns that you'd like to add to another query, you merge the queries.* When you have additional rows of data that you'd like to add to an existing query, you append the query.Box 2: Disable the query load -Managing loading of queries -In many situations, it makes sense to break down your data transformations in multiple queries. One popular example is merging where you merge two queries into one to essentially do a join. In this type of situations, some queries are not relevant to load into Desktop as they are intermediate steps, while they are still required for your data transformations to work correctly. For these queries, you can make sure they are not loaded in Desktop by un-checking 'Enable load' in the context menu of the query in Desktop or in the Properties screen:Reference:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-shape-and-combine-data https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/refresh-include-in-report-refresh

HOTSPOT -You are creating a Microsoft Power BI data model that has the tables shown in the following table.The Products table is related to the ProductCategory table through the ProductCategoryID column. Each product has one product category.You need to ensure that you can analyze sales by product category.How should you configure the relationship from ProductCategory to Products? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.Hot Area: 
Suggested Answer: Box 1: One-to-many -The one-to-many and many-to-one cardinality options are essentially the same, and they're also the most common cardinality types.Incorrect: A many-to-many relationship means both columns can contain duplicate values. This cardinality type is infrequently used. It's typically useful when designing complex model requirements. You can use it to relate many-to-many facts or to relate higher grain facts. For example, when sales target facts are stored at product category level and the product dimension table is stored at product level.Box 2: Single -Incorrect:Bear in mind that bi-directional relationships can impact negatively on performance. Further, attempting to configure a bi-directional relationship could result in ambiguous filter propagation paths. In this case, Power BI Desktop may fail to commit the relationship change and will alert you with an error message.Reference:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-relationships-understand
